ðŸŽ‰ Just completed my first badge on Snowflake's Hands-On Essentials: Data Warehousing Workshop! 

ðŸš€ This interactive course provided a great refresher and extension of my previous experience with Oracle databases (8 to 12c). 
It covered: 
- Creating and managing Snowflake databases, schemas, and tables 
- Loading and querying JSON data 
- Managing compute resources (Snowflake Warehouses) 
- Data loading techniques using various methods

It was fascinating to see how Snowflake builds on traditional database concepts while introducing cloud-native features. 
Excited to apply these new skills and compare them with my Oracle background in real-world data projects!
